Linova and Kingdom (https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1336/A):
	For any tree problems where the number of nodes is n and the special nodes to be
	selected among these n nodes are k. 
	If there is a restriction that n,k are less than 1000 or 2000,
	then it's a very strong signal that you have to use DP on the tree. 

Optimization problems on trees are generally DP.
If not DP, maybe it's greedy

FOR DATA STRUCTURES WHERE YOU CAN INSERT REMOVE AND RETRIEVE maximum elements:
MaxHeap
